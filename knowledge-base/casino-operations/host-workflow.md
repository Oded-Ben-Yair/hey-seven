# Casino Host Daily Workflow

## Role Definition

A casino VIP host manages relationships with high-value guests to increase revenues. Three primary duties: identify and attract premium players, negotiate services based on play level, maintain information and relationships.

## Portfolio Structure

A typical host manages 300-450 players total.
- Tier 1 (intensive): 70-120 active players, regular personal contact
- Tier 2 (periodic): 150-200 active-fading or in-development players, monthly outreach
- Tier 3 (monitoring): 50-150 pending or reactivation prospects, quarterly contact

Top 5% of portfolio typically contributes 30-40% of host revenue.

## Daily Schedule

### Morning Preparation (40-60 minutes before shift)

Review overnight reports and business intelligence dashboards. Check player alerts for birthdays, anniversaries, declining activity, upcoming visits. Review system-generated Daily Action Plan with prioritized recommendations. Plan call list and floor monitoring priorities.

Data reviewed each morning:
- Player tracking reports: coin-in, theoretical, win/loss
- CRM notifications: birthdays, anniversaries, preferences
- Compliance flags: KYC updates, AML concerns
- Communication logs: recent outreach and response rates
- Promotional calendar: events, tournaments, property initiatives

### Shift Operations (8-12 hours)

Floor time (70-85% of shift):
- Greet and engage assigned VIP players on property
- Monitor gaming activity and satisfaction levels
- Make real-time comp decisions based on observed play
- Coordinate with pit managers, dealers, floor supervisors
- Respond to player requests immediately

Digital tasks (15-30% of shift):
- CRM data entry and player notes
- Email correspondence (50-150 emails daily)
- SMS campaign coordination
- Comp approval documentation
- Report generation and analysis
- Compliance documentation

### Evening and Shift End

Document all player interactions in CRM. Prepare handoff notes for next shift. Confirm arrangements for next-day guest arrivals. Log any escalated issues requiring follow-up.

## Shift Differences

### Morning shift (9/10 AM - mid-afternoon)
Focus: Planning, preparation, proactive outreach. More flexibility for call campaigns. Greeting arriving guests.

### Afternoon shift (1/2 PM - 9/10 PM)
Focus: Highest on-property guest concentration. Reactive service demands. Peak guest service requirements.

### Evening shift (5/6 PM - midnight/1 AM)
Focus: Dinner and nightlife guests. Managing entertainment events. Peak activity 6-9 PM and 10 PM-midnight.

### Weekend vs. Weekday
Weekends: 2-3x floor traffic. More couples and groups. 12-16 hour shifts during holidays. Standardized comp offerings. Reduced call campaigns.
Weekdays: Business travelers, frequent individuals. Longer call campaigns possible. Relationship-focused day-specific incentives.

## Prioritization Framework

Priority order each day:
1. Escalated player issues or complaints requiring resolution
2. Players currently on property on the casino floor
3. Previously committed players with scheduled appointments
4. Proactive outreach to high-response-probability players
5. Players absent 30+ days (diagnose reason)
6. Players showing early churn signals (pre-emptive retention)

Strategic goal: Drive one or more trips from 80% of active players each quarter.

## Contact Targets

Daily: 5-7 substantive player contacts (calls, personal meetings)
Quarterly: 95% of active players contacted
Monthly: All active-due-back and active-fading players
Quarterly: All pending and pending-inactive players

## Technology Used

Primary CRM systems: Salesforce (customized for gaming), PowerHost CRM, Quick Custom Intelligence (QCI), Gaming Analytics platform.

Player tracking systems: SYNKROS (Konami), ADVANTAGE (IGT), CasinoTrac.

Mobile apps: Gaming Analytics Mobile, Pillars PRM (real-time patron intel, mobile approvals).

Additional tools: Email platforms, SMS gateways, property management systems, casino cage management, workforce scheduling (Casino Schedule Ease).

## Key Performance Indicators

- Monthly active VIPs (count of players maintained in active status)
- Average Revenue Per VIP (ARPV)
- Time-to-resolution for player issues
- Trips generated from assigned players
- New player acquisitions
- Player retention rate and churn rate
- Reinvestment efficiency (ROI on comps)
- Call completion rate with documented outcomes

Best practice: Limit to 2-3 KPIs maximum. One individual (revenue), one team (event fills), one efficiency (calls with outcomes).

## Common Challenges

Host departments receive all guest issues from other departments. Too much time on low-value comp requests. Hosts not informed about offers sent to their players. Constantly changing bonus programs. Tension between floor presence and office-based outreach. Disjointed technology systems. Slow escalation SLAs.
