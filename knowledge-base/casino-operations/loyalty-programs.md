## Theoretical Loss Formula (Industry Standard)

The foundation of all casino loyalty programs is the Average Daily Theoretical (ADT):

```
ADT = Average Bet x House Edge x Decisions Per Hour x Hours Played
```

### Comp Allocation from Theoretical Loss
Casinos return a percentage of theoretical loss back to players as comps:

| Player Segment | Reinvestment Rate | Typical ADT |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Casual | 15% | Under $100 |
| Mid-tier | 20% | $100-$500 |
| Premium | 25-30% | $500-$2,000 |
| High-roller | 30-40% | $2,000+ |

### Practical Example
A player with $500 ADT at a 25% reinvestment rate generates a $125 daily comp budget. Over a 3-night stay, this yields $375 in comps distributed across room, dining, entertainment, and free play.

### Key Insight for Hosts
Players often misunderstand comp math. They compare their actual losses to comps received. A player who loses $2,000 but had only $400 in theoretical may feel under-comped. Hosts must educate sensitively: "Your comp level is based on your overall play pattern, and I want to make sure you're getting the best value."

## Cross-Program Comparison for Connecticut Properties

For Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods (the two Connecticut tribal casinos), the programs share key similarities:
- Both use semi-annual reset schedules
- Both have 4-5 tiers with invite-only top tier
- Both offer flexibility in comp redemption (dining, retail, entertainment)
- Key differentiator: Mohegan Momentum Dollars offer broader 1:1 redemption across 100+ venues
- Foxwoods' larger gaming floor means more diverse game selection for earning

Guests frequently hold cards at both properties. Hosts should acknowledge this without disparaging competitors.
