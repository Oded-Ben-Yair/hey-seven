## Mission & Product

Hey Seven is building an autonomous AI casino VIP host that replaces human hosts entirely. The platform uses agentic AI to manage VIP player relationships, deliver personalized experiences, and optimize comp (complimentary) decisions -- all autonomously, 24/7, in any language.

**Core product capabilities**:
- Conversational AI for VIP guest interactions
- Behavioral insights and player profiling
- Automated comp optimization (deciding what incentives to offer each player)
- Compliance and responsible gambling safety layers
- Multi-language support
- Four-step intelligent AI process flow for player experience

**Business value proposition**:
- Unlock hundreds of millions in EBITDA currently left on the table
- Scale VIP programs without proportional headcount growth
- Identify high-potential players flying under the radar
- Eliminate host-dependent bottlenecks (slow response, limited scale)

## Key Differentiator

**Full autonomous host replacement.** Every competitor in the casino AI space either augments human hosts (gives them better data/tools), automates single channels (voice-only or SMS-only), or optimizes CRM/marketing campaigns. Hey Seven is the only company building AI that actually replaces the casino host function end-to-end.

The "agentic" designation is critical: the AI initiates actions (adjusting incentives, engagement cadence, offer timing), not just recommends them. This is a structural shift from decision-support to autonomous decision-making in the VIP space.

## Strategic Positioning

Hey Seven is positioning itself as **governance infrastructure**, not growth tooling. The Ashkenazi appointment signals:

1. Target buyer is board/C-suite, not CRM managers
2. Product must be defensible under regulatory scrutiny
3. Emphasis on auditability, human override, and escalation
4. US-first in tightly regulated jurisdictions

**Key question for regulators**: When an AI agent adjusts incentives, limits, or engagement cadence -- who is the decision-maker? Hey Seven must answer this convincingly.
