## Website

- **URL**: [heyseven.ai](https://heyseven.ai)
- **Technology**: JavaScript-rendered (Wix-based platform)
- **Demo page**: [heyseven.ai/requestademo/](https://heyseven.ai/requestademo/)
- **Related domain**: heyseven.com (SSL certificate error; unclear if same entity)
- **Copyright**: "Hey Seven 2025 -- Copyright | All Rights Reserved"

**Note**: The website is JS-rendered, so full visual extraction (colors, fonts, imagery, layout) requires browser-control with Playwright. WebFetch returned only "Hey Seven" text content -- the site loads dynamically.

## Messaging & Copy

### Primary Taglines

1. **Hero**: "The Autonomous Casino Host That Never Sleeps"
   - Note: "Autonomos" appears in the meta title (likely a typo in the original)
2. **Sub-hero**: "The Agentic AI Casino VIP Host Always On -- Anytime, Anywhere, in Any Language"

### Problem Framing (from website)

The messaging follows a classic problem-solution structure:

**Problems stated**:
- "Manual operations, capped databases, and overlooked high-potential players leave hundreds of millions in EBITDA untapped"
- "Host-dependent, slow response, limited scale"
- "No efficient expansion path for growing VIP programs"
- "High-potential players flying under the radar"
- "Hundreds of millions in potential EBITDA uplift currently untapped"

**Solution stated**:
- "The complete solution for automated VIP casino management"
- "Four-step player experience with intelligent AI process flow"

**Market gap claim**:
- "Existing solutions miss the mark for casino VIP management"
- "No one else is building AI specifically to replace casino hosts and optimize VIP experiences"

### CTA Language

- "Join leading casinos already transforming their player engagement"
- "See Hey Seven in action with a personalized demo"

### Tone Analysis

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| Formality | Professional, B2B enterprise |
| Confidence | Highly assertive ("No one else is building...") |
| Urgency | Moderate (EBITDA loss framing) |
| Technical depth | Low on website (business outcome focused) |
| Target audience | Casino operations executives, not engineers |
| Language | English-first, multilingual capability implied |

## Visual Identity

### Confirmed Elements

- **Company name styling**: "Hey Seven" (two words, title case)
- **Website platform**: Wix (JS-rendered)

### TBD -- Requires Browser-Control Extraction

The following could not be extracted via WebFetch due to the JS-rendered nature of the site. These require Playwright browser-control to capture:

- [ ] Primary brand colors (hex values)
- [ ] Secondary/accent colors
- [ ] Typography (font family, weights)
- [ ] Logo design (shape, color, icon)
- [ ] Hero imagery style (illustrations, photos, abstract)
- [ ] Icon system
- [ ] Background patterns/textures
- [ ] Button styles and hover states
- [ ] Animation/motion design patterns
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Browser Extraction Command (for future use)

```
/browser-control
Navigate to heyseven.ai
Wait for full JS render (5+ seconds)
Take full-page screenshot at 1440x900
Extract: CSS custom properties, computed styles on key elements, logo/image assets
```

## Brand Positioning Map

Based on messaging analysis, Hey Seven positions itself on two axes:

```
                    Full Autonomy (REPLACE host)
                           ^
                           |
                    [Hey Seven]
                           |
    Analytics-Only --------+-------- Action-Taking
                           |
                           |
                    Human Augmentation (ASSIST host)
```

**Hey Seven occupies the top-right quadrant**: Action-taking + Full autonomy. No other discovered competitor occupies this exact space.

## Naming Analysis

"Hey Seven" -- potential name origins:

1. **Lucky 7**: Casino/gambling symbolism (7 is the iconic lucky number in craps, slots)
2. **"Hey" prefix**: Conversational, approachable -- aligns with AI chat/voice agent product
3. **Domain choice**: heyseven.ai (.ai domain signals AI-first company)

The name effectively communicates both the casino domain (Seven) and the conversational AI nature (Hey) of the product.

## Competitor Brand Comparison

| Company | Tagline | Tone |
|---------|---------|------|
| Hey Seven | "The Autonomous Casino Host That Never Sleeps" | Bold, replacement-focused |
| QCI | "Quick Custom Intelligence" | Enterprise, analytical |
| Gaming Analytics | "A.I. For Casinos" | Simple, direct |
| Callers.ai | "AI Agents For Gaming & Casino" | Functional, multi-industry |
| Smartico | "Unified CRM & Gamification Solution for iGaming" | Feature-comprehensive |
| Optimove | "#1 iGaming CRM Marketing Solution" | Market-leader positioning |
| Voxia AI | "24/7 AI Call Agents" | Availability-focused |

Hey Seven's messaging is the most aggressive -- it explicitly claims to REPLACE, not assist, human hosts. This is a deliberate category-creation strategy.

## Job Posting Brand Voice (Dec 2025)

From the AI Lead job posting on mploy.co.il, the employer brand voice is:

> "Hey Seven is an AI-native platform transforming how casinos and hospitality brands engage VIP and high-value guests. We combine conversational AI, behavioral insights, and automated comp optimization to deliver personalized, compliant, and revenue-driving interactions at scale."

**Hashtags used**: #Hiring #AIEngineering #LLM #MachineLearning #IsraelJobs #GamingTech

This suggests the employer brand targets:
- AI/ML engineers in Israel
- People interested in LLM/agent systems
- The intersection of gaming tech and AI

## Industry Analyst Framing (Gaming Eminence)

Gaming Eminence, a respected industry analysis site, framed Hey Seven's positioning as:

- "AI-driven VIP control as governance infrastructure rather than growth tooling"
- Emphasis on "accountability" and "defensibility"
- Positioned as "risk-governed infrastructure" not "revenue accelerant"

This suggests the brand may evolve toward a compliance/governance-first message as it matures, rather than pure growth/revenue messaging.
