## Product & Value Proposition

**Tagline**: "The Autonomous Casino Host That Never Sleeps"

**Sub-tagline**: "The Agentic AI Casino VIP Host Always On -- Anytime, Anywhere, in Any Language"

**Self-description** (from AI Lead job posting, Dec 2025):
> Hey Seven is an AI-native platform transforming how casinos and hospitality brands engage VIP and high-value guests. We combine conversational AI, behavioral insights, and automated comp optimization to deliver personalized, compliant, and revenue-driving interactions at scale.

**Key messaging from website**:
- Manual operations, capped databases, and overlooked high-potential players leave hundreds of millions in EBITDA untapped
- Host-dependent, slow response, limited scale
- No efficient expansion path for growing VIP programs
- High-potential players flying under the radar
- Hundreds of millions in potential EBITDA uplift currently untapped
- "The complete solution for automated VIP casino management"
- "Four-step player experience with intelligent AI process flow"

**Market Gap Claim**: "No one else is building AI specifically to replace casino hosts and optimize VIP experiences."

**Key Differentiator**: FULL autonomous host replacement. Competitors augment human hosts; Hey Seven replaces them entirely with agentic AI.

## Leadership & Team

### Rafi Ashkenazi -- Executive Chair

Appointed January 2026. This is the highest-profile appointment.

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Current Primary Role | Executive Chairman, Hard Rock Digital |
| Previous Role | CEO, The Stars Group (2016-2020) |
| Education | Industrial Engineering, Shenkar College, Israel |
| Career Path | Playtech COO -> Rational Group COO -> Stars Group CEO -> Flutter NED -> Hard Rock Digital |

**Key career achievements**:
- Led The Stars Group acquisition of Sky Betting & Gaming ($5B)
- Oversaw TSG's $12B merger with Flutter Entertainment (created world's largest online gambling company)
- Diversified PokerStars from poker-only into casino + sportsbook
- Currently building Hard Rock's global digital gaming business (130M+ customer database, 250 properties in 76 countries)

**Why this matters for Hey Seven**: Ashkenazi is not a retired advisor. He is an active operator chair (Hard Rock Digital) aligning with a supplier in the most regulated part of the gambling stack: VIP account management. This signals that Hey Seven's target buyer is senior management/boards, not CRM leads.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (VIP Host / Player Development)

| Company | Focus | Scale | Key Differentiator |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **QCI Host** (Quick Custom Intelligence) | Player development platform | 300+ casinos, $42B+ annual GGR managed | Established market leader. AGI56 platform. Host workflow management. Augments human hosts. |
| **Gaming Analytics** | AI analytics for casino floor | Founded 2017, San Rafael CA | Graph database architecture. Floor optimization + fraud detection. Analytics-first, not host replacement. |
| **Callers.ai** | AI voice agents for gaming | Growing | Voice/SMS/WhatsApp. 40% bonus activation, 60% cost reduction claims. Outbound calls, not full host replacement. |
| **Voxia AI** | AI voice agents for casino support | Growing | 24/7 customer support. 87% query handling without humans. Support-focused, not VIP relationship management. |

### Adjacent Competitors (CRM / Engagement)

| Company | Focus | Scale | Key Differentiator |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **Optimove** | iGaming CRM + AI personalization | Powers 56% of EGR Power 50 operators (Bet365, Entain, FDJ) | OptiGenie predictive AI. Multichannel orchestration. CRM platform, not autonomous host. |
| **Smartico** | Unified CRM + Gamification | Expanding into US via SCCG partnership | Gamification + CRM in one. AI churn prediction. Player engagement, not VIP hosting. |
| **ZingBrain** | Personalized casino lobby recommendations | Growing (17% GGR/player uplift for CatAffs) | Netflix-style game recommendations. Lobby personalization, not host replacement. |
| **SevenRooms** | Hospitality CRM (restaurants, nightlife, casinos) | 250+ cities worldwide (Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Hard Rock) | Table management, guest profiles, VIP tagging. Hospitality-broad, not casino-specific AI. |

### Hey Seven's Unique Position

**No direct competitor is building full autonomous host replacement.** All competitors either:
1. **Augment human hosts** (QCI Host -- gives hosts better data/workflows)
2. **Automate single channels** (Callers.ai, Voxia -- voice/SMS only)
3. **Optimize CRM/marketing** (Optimove, Smartico -- campaign orchestration)
4. **Analyze data** (Gaming Analytics -- insights, not actions)

Hey Seven's "agentic" framing means the AI initiates actions, not just recommends them. This is a fundamentally different category.

## Strategic Analysis (from Gaming Eminence article)

The Gaming Eminence article provides the most sophisticated external analysis of Hey Seven's positioning:

1. **Governance signal, not growth signal**: Ashkenazi's appointment is about regulatory credibility, not product expertise
2. **Target buyer**: Senior management and boards, not CRM leads
3. **Regulatory challenge**: VIP is the most scrutinized part of gambling. Agentic AI (systems that act, not just recommend) raises accountability questions
4. **Four success indicators** to watch:
   - Product posture: Emphasis on auditability and human override (vs. pure autonomy)
   - Buyer profile: Sales through compliance/risk teams (vs. commercial only)
   - Jurisdictional focus: US-first in tightly regulated markets
   - Regulatory engagement: Proactive dialogue with regulators
