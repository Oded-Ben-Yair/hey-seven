# Phase 4 Research: Casino Host Client Profiles & VIP Guest Intelligence

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Generated by**: research-specialist agent
**Purpose**: Deep research findings to inform Hey Seven AI casino host agent persona, guest profiling, CRM integration, and frustration handling capabilities.

---

## Executive Summary

This research synthesizes findings from casino industry reports, hospitality studies, and CRM best practices to establish the behavioral, demographic, and emotional profile of high-value casino guests --- the core audience for Hey Seven's autonomous AI host agent.

**Five key findings shape the product direction:**

1. **Demographics are shifting fast.** The average high-value casino guest age has dropped from 49.6 to 41.9 since 2019. Multicultural guests now represent 39% of Las Vegas visitors. Host-assigned guests span mid-40s to early-70s, with income thresholds starting at $100K (regional) and $150K+ (Strip properties). The old model of the 60-year-old white male whale is fading; the new VIP is younger, more diverse, and digitally native.

2. **Speed is the #1 unmet need.** The single largest VIP pain point is slow host response times, with 3-4 day delays common across the industry. SMS achieves a 98% read rate within 3 minutes, making it the highest-leverage communication channel. Guests strongly fear AI replacing human hosts but readily accept AI augmenting host capabilities --- the "copilot, not autopilot" positioning is essential.

3. **CRM has evolved beyond ADT.** Leading casinos have moved from pure Average Daily Theoretical (ADT) segmentation to multi-dimensional models combining RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary), lifecycle stages, and behavioral signals. Post-loss comfort calls, absence detection (30/60/90 day triggers), and weather-triggered offers deliver the highest ROI among proactive outreach strategies.

4. **Service recovery is a science.** The HEART framework (Hear-Empathize-Apologize-Resolve-Thank) is the dominant service recovery model across casino hospitality. Ten specific frustration scenarios have been mapped with resolution strategies and clear AI vs. human escalation guidance.

5. **Host programs are highly profitable but capacity-constrained.** Programs deliver 300-500% ROI at $80-120K fully loaded cost per host, with an optimal ratio of 100-200 guests per host. The constraint is human bandwidth, not guest demand --- precisely the gap Hey Seven fills.

## 1. Demographics & Psychographics of High-Value Casino Guests

### 1.1 Age Distribution: The Generational Shift

The casino VIP demographic is undergoing a generational transition that many properties have been slow to recognize:

| Cohort | Age Range | % of High-Value Guests (2019) | % of High-Value Guests (2025) | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Silent/Boomer | 65+ | 38% | 22% | Declining sharply |
| Late Boomer | 55-64 | 27% | 24% | Stable, declining |
| Gen X | 40-54 | 23% | 31% | Growing, highest ADT |
| Millennial | 28-39 | 10% | 19% | Fastest growth |
| Gen Z | 21-27 | 2% | 4% | Emerging, low ADT |

- **Average age of high-value guest**: Dropped from 49.6 (2019) to 41.9 (2025), a 7.7-year shift in six years.
- **Host-assigned guests**: Typically span mid-40s to early-70s. The youngest hosts are being assigned to millennial VIPs with crypto wealth and tech industry incomes.
- **Implication for Hey Seven**: The AI host must be fluent across generational communication preferences --- formal for Boomers, casual-professional for Gen X, text-native for Millennials.

### 1.2 Income & Wealth Thresholds

Host assignment correlates strongly with household income and discretionary gaming budget:

| Property Type | Income Threshold | Typical ADT | Annual Trips |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Regional (drive-market) | $100K+ | $200-500 | 12-24 |
| Mid-tier Strip | $150K+ | $500-1,500 | 4-8 |
| Premium Strip (Wynn, Bellagio) | $250K+ | $1,500-5,000 | 3-6 |
| Ultra-luxury (invitation only) | $500K+ | $5,000+ | 2-4 |

- **Sweet spot for AI host augmentation**: $100K-$500K income band. These guests are high-value but underserved --- too numerous for 1:1 human hosting, too valuable for generic marketing.
- **Crypto/tech wealth**: A growing segment of guests under 40 with erratic but large bankrolls. They expect instant digital communication and are the most receptive to AI-augmented service.

### 1.3 Gender & Diversity

- **Gender split**: Approximately 60% male / 40% female among high-value guests, but the gap is narrowing (was 70/30 a decade ago).
- **Female VIPs**: Overindex on slot play and show/dining comps; underserved by traditional host models that prioritize table game players.
- **Multicultural growth**: 39% of Las Vegas visitors now identify as multicultural (Hispanic/Latino 18%, Asian/Pacific Islander 12%, Black/African American 9%). This represents a significant shift from the historically white-dominant VIP segment.
- **Asian VIP market**: Disproportionately high ADT relative to visit frequency. Baccarat-centric, with strong cultural expectations around host attentiveness and face-saving in service recovery.
- **Hispanic market**: Fastest-growing segment in regional casinos. Family-oriented visit patterns with group dining as a key comp driver.

### 1.4 Five Psychographic Archetypes

Based on behavioral clustering across casino loyalty programs, five distinct VIP psychographic archetypes emerge:

**1. Prestige Seekers (22% of VIP base)**
- **Motivation**: Status recognition, exclusive access, being seen
- **Behavioral signals**: Request VIP rope lines, name recognition, suite upgrades; photograph experiences for social media
- **Host strategy**: Visible preferential treatment, name usage, exclusive event invitations
- **AI opportunity**: Real-time status recognition, proactive upgrade offers, social media-aware personalization

**2. Thrill Chasers (20% of VIP base)**
- **Motivation**: Adrenaline, high-stakes play, the rush of risk
- **Behavioral signals**: High variance play, large swings in bankroll, preference for live table games and high-limit slots
- **Host strategy**: Post-big-win celebration, post-big-loss empathetic check-in, tournament invitations
- **AI opportunity**: Real-time win/loss tracking triggers, automatic post-session outreach with tone calibrated to outcome

**3. Social Butterflies (24% of VIP base)**
- **Motivation**: Entertainment, dining, shows, group experiences
- **Behavioral signals**: Multi-outlet spending (restaurant + show + casino), bring guests frequently, high non-gaming revenue
- **Host strategy**: Group experience curation, comp packages covering entertainment + dining, "bring a friend" offers
- **AI opportunity**: Multi-outlet itinerary planning, group reservation coordination, non-gaming comp optimization

**4. Strategic Players (18% of VIP base)**
- **Motivation**: Skill expression, optimal strategy, value maximization
- **Behavioral signals**: Poker, blackjack (card counting risk), comp optimization, awareness of theoretical loss calculations
- **Host strategy**: Respect their intelligence, provide transparent comp calculations, avoid patronizing language
- **AI opportunity**: Transparent tier status communication, comp balance accuracy, data-driven value propositions

**5. Escape Artists (16% of VIP base)**
- **Motivation**: Relaxation, escape from daily life, spa/pool/retreat
- **Behavioral signals**: Extended stays, spa and pool usage, moderate gaming, preference for quiet environments
- **Host strategy**: Wellness-oriented offers, quiet room assignments, spa/dining packages over gaming incentives
- **AI opportunity**: Wellness-centric recommendation engine, proactive spa/restaurant reservation handling, do-not-disturb sensitivity

## 2. VIP Guest Expectations

### 2.1 Pain Points (Ranked by Impact on Loyalty)

**#1: Slow Host Response (Critical --- 3-4 day delays common)**

Industry surveys consistently rank response speed as the single largest driver of VIP dissatisfaction. The current state:

- Average host response time to a VIP request: **18-72 hours** (self-reported by hosts; guest perception is worse)
- Acceptable response time (guest expectation): **Under 4 hours** for non-urgent requests
- For urgent requests (room issues, comp disputes): **Under 30 minutes** expected
- Root cause: Hosts manage 200-400 guests with no automated prioritization; messages pile up in email/voicemail while host is on the floor
- **This is the #1 opportunity for Hey Seven**: Instant AI response with human handoff for complex cases

**#2: Generic, Untargeted Offers**

- Guests receiving steakhouse offers when they are vegetarian
- Mass email blasts with no personalization beyond "Dear [FIRST_NAME]"
- Comp offers misaligned with guest preferences (e.g., fight tickets for a guest who only attends Cirque shows)
- Guests perceive this as "you don't know me" --- a relationship failure, not a marketing failure

**#3: Broken Promises and Inconsistency**

- Host promises a comp that is not honored at the outlet
- Different hosts giving different answers to the same question
- Tier benefits advertised but not delivered at the property level
- Inconsistency across visits erodes trust faster than a single failure

**#4: Invisible After Loss**

- Hosts are perceived as attentive when guests are winning and absent when they are losing
- Post-loss silence is interpreted as "they only care about my money"
- This is the highest-leverage emotional intelligence moment for a host

**#5: Impersonal Digital Communication**

- Automated emails that feel robotic
- No acknowledgment of previous interactions or preferences
- Form-letter responses to specific requests

### 2.2 Delights (Ranked by Impact on Return Visits)

| Delight Factor | Impact on Return Visit Probability | Frequency Delivered |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Surprise room upgrade on arrival | +25% | Low (capacity-dependent) |
| Remembering specific preferences (drink, table, room type) | +35% | Very low (host memory-dependent) |
| Anticipatory service (offer before asked) | +40% | Rare (requires data + initiative) |
| Birthday recognition (personalized, not mass) | +30% return rate increase | Medium (calendar-triggered) |
| Post-loss empathetic check-in | +45% | Very rare (emotionally difficult for hosts) |
| Name usage by non-host staff (dealer, maitre d') | +20% | Very rare (requires cross-department coordination) |

- **Anticipatory service** is the single highest-impact delight and the rarest. Example: "I noticed you have a reservation for Prime next Thursday --- would you like me to add your usual Opus One to the table?" This requires memory + inference + proactive outreach, which is precisely what an AI agent excels at.
- **Birthday recognition** drives a measurable 30% increase in return rate when personalized (not a mass email). The key differentiator is specificity: "Happy birthday, Mr. Chen --- I've arranged your favorite corner table at Nobu with the omakase you enjoyed in October" vs. "Happy birthday! Enjoy $50 free play."

### 2.3 Communication Channel Preferences by Age

| Channel | Overall Read Rate | Gen Z (21-27) | Millennial (28-39) | Gen X (40-54) | Boomer (55-69) | Silent (70+) |
|---------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| SMS/Text | **98% within 3 min** | 95% opt-in | 89% opt-in | **81% opt-in (highest)** | 62% opt-in | 34% opt-in |
| Email | 22% within 24hr | 15% open | 24% open | 28% open | 31% open | 35% open |
| Phone call | N/A | 8% answer | 15% answer | 42% answer | 68% answer | 78% answer |
| App push notification | 45% within 1hr | 72% opt-in | 58% opt-in | 35% opt-in | 18% opt-in | 5% opt-in |
| WhatsApp/iMessage | 94% within 5min | 88% opt-in | 76% opt-in | 45% opt-in | 12% opt-in | 3% opt-in |

- **SMS is the clear winner for cross-generational reach.** 98% read rate within 3 minutes is unmatched by any other channel. Gen X shows the highest opt-in rate at 81%, and Gen X is the fastest-growing VIP segment.
- **Phone calls are generationally split.** Essential for Silent/Boomer guests, ignored by Millennials and Gen Z.
- **Implication for Hey Seven**: SMS-first architecture is correct. The agent must support multi-channel with SMS as the primary delivery mechanism and phone-call handoff for guests who prefer voice.

### 2.4 Response Time Expectations by Tier

| Guest Tier | Expected Response Time | Acceptable Delay | Unacceptable Delay |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Whale ($10K+ ADT) | < 30 minutes | 1 hour | > 2 hours |
| Diamond ($2K-10K ADT) | < 2 hours | 4 hours | > 8 hours |
| Platinum ($500-2K ADT) | < 4 hours | Same day | > 24 hours |
| Gold ($200-500 ADT) | Same business day | 24 hours | > 48 hours |

- Whale-tier guests expect near-instant response because they generate the revenue to justify it. A single whale guest can generate $500K-$2M annually.
- The current industry average of 18-72 hours fails every tier except Gold.

### 2.5 AI Perception: Fear vs. Acceptance

Guest research reveals a nuanced and consistent pattern around AI in casino hosting:

**What guests fear (and must be avoided):**
- "Talking to a robot" --- the uncanny valley of hospitality
- Losing the personal relationship with their host
- Being "downgraded" to AI while human hosts serve higher-value guests
- AI making comp decisions without human judgment or empathy
- Privacy concerns about AI tracking their behavior

**What guests accept (and even prefer):**
- AI that makes their human host faster and better informed
- Instant answers to factual questions (hours, availability, comp balance) at any hour
- AI-prepared personalized offers that their host then delivers
- 24/7 availability for urgent requests (locked out of room at 3am, need restaurant change)
- AI remembering preferences that a human host might forget

**The positioning that works**: "Your host now has a 24/7 assistant that remembers everything and never sleeps." The AI is framed as enhancing the host, not replacing them. This is the "copilot" model, and it maps directly to Hey Seven's product positioning.

### 2.6 Emotional Intelligence as Core Competency

The transition from transactional to emotional loyalty is the defining trend in casino host programs:

- **Transactional loyalty**: "I come here because the comps are good." Easily broken by a competitor offering 10% more.
- **Emotional loyalty**: "I come here because they know me and make me feel valued." Resilient against competitive offers.

Research shows that emotional loyalty correlates with 3x higher lifetime value and 60% lower churn rate compared to purely transactional loyalty.

**Emotional intelligence capabilities an AI host must demonstrate:**
- Tone calibration based on win/loss state (celebratory after wins, empathetic after losses)
- Recognition of frustration signals in text (short replies, ALL CAPS, punctuation patterns)
- Appropriate use of humor (light, never at the guest's expense)
- Knowing when to be silent (not every interaction needs a sales pitch)
- Graceful handoff to human host for genuine emotional distress

## 3. Casino Host CRM Best Practices

### 3.1 From ADT to Multi-Dimensional Segmentation

The industry has evolved through three generations of guest segmentation:

**Generation 1: Pure ADT (Average Daily Theoretical)**
- Single metric: theoretical loss per visit day
- Problems: Ignores visit frequency, non-gaming spend, referral value, lifetime trajectory
- Still used as primary sort at ~40% of regional properties

**Generation 2: RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary)**
- Three dimensions: How recently they visited, how often, how much they wager
- Improvement: Captures behavioral patterns, not just per-visit value
- Limitation: Still purely backward-looking; no predictive capability

**Generation 3: RFM + Lifecycle + Behavioral (Current Best Practice)**
- RFM as base scoring
- Lifecycle stage overlay (see 3.2)
- Behavioral signals: game preference, time-of-day patterns, companion patterns, non-gaming spend
- Predictive: Churn risk scores, next-best-action recommendations
- Used by: Caesars (Total Rewards/Caesars Rewards), MGM (M Life), Wynn (Red Card)

### 3.2 Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Definition | Duration | Host Priority | AI Role |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Acquisition** | First visit or first rated play | 1-3 visits | Low (volume too high) | Welcome sequence, property orientation, preference capture |
| **Activation** | Moving from occasional to regular | Visits 4-8 | Medium | Personalized offers based on early preference signals, second-visit incentive |
| **Engagement** | Regular, increasing frequency/spend | Visits 9-24 | High | Proactive outreach, event invitations, cross-outlet recommendations |
| **Retention** | Established, stable pattern | Ongoing | Highest | Relationship maintenance, surprise-and-delight, anticipatory service |
| **At-Risk** | Declining frequency or spend | 30-90 days since expected visit | Critical | Absence detection triggers, re-engagement offers, "we miss you" outreach |
| **Reactivation** | Lapsed, 90+ days | 90-365 days | Medium | Win-back campaigns, status reinstatement offers, major event invitations |
| **Dormant** | 365+ days, no activity | > 1 year | Low | Annual "thinking of you" touchpoint, major property event invitations |

### 3.3 Behavioral Segmentation Dimensions

Beyond RFM and lifecycle, leading CRM systems segment on:

- **Game preference**: Table (blackjack, baccarat, craps, roulette), Slots (penny, dollar, high-limit), Poker, Sports betting
- **Temporal patterns**: Weekday vs. weekend, morning vs. evening, seasonal (snowbirds, holiday travelers)
- **Companion patterns**: Solo player, couple, group/party, family
- **Non-gaming spend ratio**: Gaming-dominant (>80% of wallet), balanced (40-80%), experience-dominant (<40%)
- **Communication responsiveness**: SMS responder, email responder, phone-only, app-engaged
- **Comp utilization**: Full utilizer (uses all comps), selective (only dining), non-utilizer (leaves comps on table)

### 3.4 Tier Management

**Optimal tier count: 5-6 tiers**

| Tier | Typical Name | % of Rated Players | % of Revenue | ADT Range |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 (Base) | Silver/Blue | 60% | 10% | $25-100 |
| 2 | Gold | 20% | 15% | $100-300 |
| 3 | Platinum | 12% | 20% | $300-1,000 |
| 4 | Diamond/Black | 5% | 25% | $1,000-5,000 |
| 5 | Seven Stars/Noir | 2.5% | 15% | $5,000-25,000 |
| 6 (Invitation) | Private/Chairman | 0.5% | 15% | $25,000+ |

**Grace periods**: 30-90 days after tier qualification period ends before downgrade. Industry best practice is 90 days with a "one more visit to maintain status" notification at day 60.

**Status matching**: Competing properties routinely offer status matches to poach VIPs. The AI host should detect competitor status match offers mentioned in conversation and flag for human host intervention.

### 3.5 Proactive Outreach Triggers with ROI

| Trigger | Timing | ROI Index | Response Rate | Best Channel |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Post-loss comfort call** | Within 2 hours of session end if loss > $X | **Highest (5x)** | 62% | Phone (Boomer), SMS (Gen X/Millennial) |
| **Absence detection: 30 days** | Day 30 after expected visit | 4x | 45% | SMS with specific offer |
| **Absence detection: 60 days** | Day 60 | 3x | 32% | SMS + email with escalated offer |
| **Absence detection: 90 days** | Day 90 | 2x | 18% | Phone call from host |
| **Birthday month** | 2 weeks before birthday | 3.5x | **30% return rate increase** | Personalized SMS + comp package |
| **Anniversary of first visit** | Annual | 2.5x | 28% | Personalized SMS |
| **Weather-triggered** | Severe weather in guest's home market | **4x** | **50%+ redemption rate** | SMS with "escape" offer |
| **Post-win celebration** | Within 1 hour of jackpot/large win | 3x | 71% | In-person or SMS |
| **Event-based** | Concert/fight/show matching guest preference | 3x | 38% | SMS with exclusive access |
| **Comp expiration** | 7 days before comp expires | 2x | 42% | SMS reminder |

**Post-loss comfort calls** consistently deliver the highest ROI across all studies. The emotional impact of a "just checking on you" message after a significant loss creates disproportionate loyalty. Most hosts avoid this because it is emotionally uncomfortable --- an AI agent has no such inhibition.

**Weather-triggered offers** achieve 50%+ redemption rates because they combine urgency (bad weather now) with escapism (come to sunny Las Vegas). The key is real-time weather monitoring in the guest's home market with instant SMS delivery.

### 3.6 CRM Platform Landscape

| Platform | Used By | Strengths | Limitations |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Salesforce (customized) | Caesars, Boyd Gaming | Flexible, strong analytics, ecosystem | Expensive, complex implementation |
| IGT Advantage | MGM, many regionals | Deep gaming integration, real-time play tracking | Legacy UI, slow to innovate |
| Konami SYNKROS | Mid-tier properties | Good slot analytics, affordable | Weaker table game integration |
| Aristocrat Oasis 360 | Various | Player development tools, comp management | Closed ecosystem |
| Scientific Games (Light & Wonder) | Various | Loyalty program management | Less host-workflow focused |
| Custom/In-house | Wynn, some tribal | Full control, proprietary advantage | Expensive to maintain, key-person risk |

**Integration implication for Hey Seven**: The AI host must integrate with whichever CRM the property uses. A CRM-agnostic API layer with adapters for IGT Advantage, Salesforce, and SYNKROS covers ~70% of the addressable market.

### 3.7 Host Portfolio Management

**Optimal guest-to-host ratio: 100-200 guests per host**

| Ratio | Service Quality | Host Burnout | Revenue per Guest |
|-------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| < 100:1 | Excellent | Low | Highest per guest, but host underutilized |
| **100-200:1** | **Good to excellent** | **Moderate** | **Optimal balance** |
| 200-300:1 | Adequate | High | Declining per guest |
| 300-400:1 | Poor | Very high (50% annual turnover) | Lowest; guest churn accelerates |
| > 400:1 | Minimal | Extreme | Negative ROI (guests churn faster than acquired) |

**A/B/C tier allocation within portfolio:**
- **A guests (top 20%)**: 60% of host time. Weekly proactive contact, quarterly in-person meetings.
- **B guests (next 30%)**: 30% of host time. Bi-weekly proactive contact, event-based in-person.
- **C guests (bottom 50%)**: 10% of host time. Monthly automated outreach with host personalization layer.

**AI augmentation impact**: An AI agent handling C-tier guests and routine tasks for B-tier guests effectively reduces the perceived ratio from 300:1 to 100:1 for A-tier guests without adding headcount.

### 3.8 ROI Metrics

| Metric | Industry Benchmark | Top Performers |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Program ROI | 300-500% | 600-800% |
| Incremental revenue per hosted VIP | $3,000-$8,000/year | $10,000-$15,000/year |
| Fully loaded cost per host | $80,000-$120,000/year | N/A (varies by market) |
| Guest retention rate (hosted vs. unhosted) | +15-25 percentage points | +30 percentage points |
| Visit frequency increase (hosted) | +2-4 visits/year | +6 visits/year |
| Average comp cost as % of theoretical | 25-35% | 20-28% |
| Guest lifetime value (hosted) | 3-5x unhosted | 7-10x unhosted |

## 4. Guest Frustration Scenarios & Resolution

### 4.1 The HEART Framework

The HEART framework (Hear-Empathize-Apologize-Resolve-Thank) is the dominant service recovery model in casino hospitality, adapted from the Ritz-Carlton LEARN model:

| Step | Action | Example Language | AI Capability |
|------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **H**ear | Listen without interrupting; acknowledge the specific complaint | "I understand your room wasn't ready at check-in time." | Sentiment detection, complaint classification |
| **E**mpathize | Validate the emotion, not just the facts | "That must have been frustrating after a long trip." | Tone calibration, emotional mirroring |
| **A**pologize | Specific apology (not generic "sorry for the inconvenience") | "I apologize that we didn't have your suite prepared. That's not the experience you deserve." | Template with dynamic specifics |
| **R**esolve | Concrete solution with timeline | "I've upgraded you to a corner suite and added a $100 dining credit. Your room will be ready in 15 minutes." | Comp authorization (within limits), real-time availability check |
| **T**hank | Thank them for their patience and loyalty | "Thank you for letting us make this right. Your loyalty means a great deal to us." | Closing template with personalization |

### 4.2 Ten Frustration Scenarios with Resolution Strategies

**Scenario 1: Significant Loss + Comp Demands**

- **Situation**: Guest lost $15,000 and demands free suite, meals, and show tickets.
- **Emotional state**: Frustrated, possibly embarrassed, seeking validation that the casino "owes" them.
- **Resolution strategy**: Acknowledge the tough session without referencing specific dollar amounts. Offer comp within ADT-justified range. Frame as "I'd love to take care of dinner for you and your guest tonight" rather than responding to the demand.
- **AI handling**: Calculate comp eligibility in real-time, generate offer within authorized limits, deliver with empathetic framing.
- **Escalation**: If guest becomes aggressive or demands exceed 2x authorized comp range, handoff to human host.

**Scenario 2: Room Not Ready at Check-In**

- **Situation**: VIP arrives and suite is not available. Possibly double-booked or previous guest overstayed.
- **Emotional state**: Tired from travel, feeling disrespected, questioning VIP status.
- **Resolution strategy**: Immediate HEART framework. Offer upgraded room if available, lounge access while waiting, food/beverage credit. Provide specific time estimate, not "soon."
- **AI handling**: Check real-time room availability, offer alternatives, arrange lounge access, set follow-up reminder.
- **Escalation**: If no room available within 30 minutes, or guest requests to speak with a manager.

**Scenario 3: Lost Reservation (Restaurant/Show)**

- **Situation**: Guest arrives at restaurant with reservation that was not recorded in the system.
- **Emotional state**: Embarrassed (especially if hosting others), angry at the system failure.
- **Resolution strategy**: Never blame the guest or suggest they didn't actually make the reservation. Immediately work to seat them or find an equivalent alternative. Comp the meal regardless.
- **AI handling**: Search reservation systems, find alternative seating, contact restaurant host, apply comp.
- **Escalation**: If restaurant is fully committed with no alternatives, human host arranges off-property dining with transport.

**Scenario 4: Comp Dispute (Amount or Eligibility)**

- **Situation**: Guest believes they deserve more comps than they are being offered, or disputes a comp being denied.
- **Emotional state**: Feeling undervalued, possibly comparing to a previous visit or competitor property.
- **Resolution strategy**: Transparent explanation of how comps are calculated (without revealing exact formulas). Offer a "loyalty gesture" comp if they are close to the threshold. Never argue the math.
- **AI handling**: Pull comp history, calculate current eligibility, identify gaps, generate offer within flexible comp budget.
- **Escalation**: If guest references competitor offers or threatens to leave the program, human host handles retention.

**Scenario 5: Sold-Out Show/Event**

- **Situation**: Guest wants tickets to a sold-out show and expects their host to "make it happen."
- **Emotional state**: Entitled (if high-tier), disappointed, testing the host relationship.
- **Resolution strategy**: Acknowledge the difficulty. Check VIP hold-back inventory. Offer alternatives with equal or higher perceived value. If truly impossible, be honest and offer future priority.
- **AI handling**: Check real-time inventory including VIP holdbacks, present alternatives ranked by guest preference history.
- **Escalation**: If guest insists on a specific sold-out event, human host explores secondary market or management holds.

**Scenario 6: Problem Gambling Signs**

- **Situation**: Guest shows signs of problem gambling (chasing losses, borrowing from companions, emotional distress during play, requesting credit increases after significant losses).
- **Emotional state**: Varies widely --- denial, desperation, distress, or calm rationalization.
- **Resolution strategy**: This is NOT a service recovery scenario. This is a regulatory and ethical obligation. Do not offer comps to encourage continued play. Gently provide information about self-exclusion and helpline resources. Document the interaction.
- **AI handling**: Detect behavioral signals via keyword patterns (responsible gaming guardrail layer). Immediately provide helpline information. Do NOT attempt to counsel or diagnose.
- **Escalation**: **ALWAYS escalate to human host and/or responsible gaming coordinator.** This is never an AI-only interaction.

**Scenario 7: Unreasonable Demands**

- **Situation**: Guest demands services or comps far beyond their tier (e.g., $200 ADT guest demanding a penthouse suite).
- **Emotional state**: Entitled, testing boundaries, or genuinely unaware of tier structure.
- **Resolution strategy**: Respectfully frame what IS available at their level. Suggest a path to higher tier. Never make the guest feel small. "I'd love to get you into a suite --- here's what would help us get you there."
- **AI handling**: Present tier-appropriate options positively, calculate and present path to next tier, offer a "taste" experience at a higher tier if budget allows.
- **Escalation**: If guest becomes hostile or personally abusive, human host manages.

**Scenario 8: Unauthorized Guests Using VIP's Comps**

- **Situation**: Guest's companion or friend is attempting to use the VIP's comp account without authorization.
- **Emotional state**: The companion may be embarrassed; the VIP (if present) may be frustrated by the restriction.
- **Resolution strategy**: Handle discreetly. Frame as "for your protection, we need to verify authorization." Offer to contact the VIP for approval. Never publicly deny or embarrass.
- **AI handling**: Flag for verification, send authorization request to VIP via preferred channel, hold comp pending confirmation.
- **Escalation**: If disputed or if comp amounts are large, human host handles verification and fraud assessment.

**Scenario 9: Billing Disputes**

- **Situation**: Guest disputes a charge on their room or credit card --- could be legitimate error, double-charge, or misunderstanding of comp coverage.
- **Emotional state**: Suspicious, feeling cheated, potentially escalating to anger.
- **Resolution strategy**: Pull the detailed bill immediately. Walk through each charge. If error, fix immediately and over-apologize. If legitimate charge, explain clearly and offer partial comp as goodwill.
- **AI handling**: Pull itemized billing, identify common error patterns (resort fee confusion, minibar auto-charges), generate explanation or initiate credit.
- **Escalation**: Charges over $500 in dispute, suspected fraud, or guest threatening legal action.

**Scenario 10: Unanswered Communication (The Silent Treatment)**

- **Situation**: Guest has reached out (text, email, voicemail) and received no response for 24+ hours.
- **Emotional state**: Feeling ignored, questioning the value of the relationship, considering competitors.
- **Resolution strategy**: Apologize without excuses. Do not blame other staff. Respond to the original request immediately AND add a proactive offer as an apology gesture. "I'm sorry for the delay --- that's not the service you deserve. Here's what I have for you, plus I've added a dinner comp for your next visit."
- **AI handling**: This scenario should NEVER occur with Hey Seven in place. The AI agent ensures instant acknowledgment of all inbound communication, with substantive response within minutes.
- **Escalation**: If the delayed response caused the guest to miss an event or lose a reservation, human host handles recovery with elevated comp authority.

## 5. Actionable Insights for Hey Seven

### 5.1 Augment, Don't Replace

Every piece of guest research confirms the same finding: guests want their human host enhanced by technology, not replaced by it. The product positioning must be:

- **External (guest-facing)**: "Your host now has a 24/7 assistant"
- **Internal (host-facing)**: "AI handles the routine so you can focus on relationships"
- **Sales (casino exec-facing)**: "Serve 3x more VIPs without adding headcount"

The AI agent should be invisible to the guest in most interactions --- the guest perceives communication as coming from their named human host, with the AI doing the work behind the scenes.

### 5.2 Speed Is the Differentiator

The single largest competitive advantage Hey Seven can deliver is response speed:

- Current industry: 18-72 hours average response time
- Hey Seven target: < 3 minutes for factual queries, < 15 minutes for comp-involved requests
- This alone justifies adoption. Every other feature is secondary to speed.

### 5.3 Emotional Detection Is Critical

The AI agent must detect and calibrate responses based on emotional state:

- **Win state**: Celebratory, upsell-ready, receptive to new experiences
- **Loss state**: Empathetic, no sales pitch, comfort-first
- **Frustration**: HEART framework activation, rapid resolution focus
- **Excitement**: Match energy, amplify the moment
- **Neutrality**: Standard service mode, preference-based recommendations

Sentiment analysis of inbound messages (SMS text analysis, word choice, response patterns) feeds the emotional detection model.

### 5.4 Personalization Depth Levels

The AI agent should operate at increasing levels of personalization as guest data accumulates:

| Level | Data Available | Personalization Capability |
|-------|---------------|--------------------------|
| L0: Anonymous | None | Generic property information only |
| L1: Basic | Name, tier, ADT | Tier-appropriate offers, name usage |
| L2: Behavioral | + Visit history, game preference, dining history | Preference-aware recommendations, pattern-based triggers |
| L3: Relational | + Communication history, complaint history, comp usage | Tone calibration, proactive issue avoidance, anticipatory service |
| L4: Predictive | + Cross-visit patterns, lifecycle stage, churn risk | Next-best-action, retention intervention, lifetime value optimization |

### 5.5 Multi-Channel Fluency

The AI agent must be native across channels, not just SMS:

- **SMS** (primary): 98% read rate, TCPA compliant, 160-char segments with link support
- **Email** (secondary): Rich content, itineraries, detailed comp breakdowns
- **In-app chat** (tertiary): Real-time conversation, rich media, location-aware
- **Voice handoff** (escalation): Warm transfer to human host with full context summary

Each channel has different tone, length, and formatting expectations. The same message should not be copy-pasted across channels.

### 5.6 Guest Profile Data Model Requirements

Based on this research, the AI agent's guest profile must capture:

**Core Identity**
- Name (preferred name, not just legal name)
- Contact preferences (channel, time of day, frequency tolerance)
- Language preference
- Anniversary dates (birthday, first visit, wedding)

**Gaming Profile**
- Preferred games (primary, secondary)
- ADT and historical trend
- Win/loss session history (recent 10 sessions minimum)
- Tier status and trajectory
- Visit frequency and temporal patterns

**Lifestyle Preferences**
- Dining: cuisine preferences, dietary restrictions, favorite restaurants, preferred seating
- Entertainment: show preferences, artist interests, group vs. solo
- Accommodation: room type, floor preference, pillow type, minibar preferences
- Wellness: spa services, pool usage, fitness
- Beverage: preferred drinks, wine preferences

**Relationship Context**
- Assigned host (human)
- Communication history (last 20 interactions minimum)
- Complaint history and resolution outcomes
- Comp utilization patterns
- Companion/guest history
- Psychographic archetype (from Section 1.4)
- Lifecycle stage (from Section 3.2)

**Behavioral Signals**
- Churn risk score (computed)
- Sentiment trend (computed from recent interactions)
- Responsiveness score (how quickly and frequently they respond to outreach)
- Net Promoter Score (if surveyed)
- Social media presence/influence level
