# Phase 4 Research: Casino Industry Regulations & Operations

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Generated by**: research-specialist agent
**Purpose**: Deep research findings for Hey Seven AI Casino Host agent -- regulatory compliance, loyalty program mechanics, F&B operations, and hotel operations across major US casino properties.

---

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates deep research across four critical domains for the Hey Seven AI casino host agent: (1) US casino marketing regulations including TCPA, self-exclusion, and BSA/AML requirements; (2) loyalty program structures and comp formulas across six major operators; (3) food and beverage operations including celebrity chef partnerships and reservation systems; and (4) hotel and room operations spanning standard rooms to ultra-VIP villas.

**Key findings**:

1. **TCPA consent revocation now requires a 10-day processing window** (effective April 2025). The FCC's one-to-one consent rule was vacated by the courts in January 2025, restoring broader consent scope for marketing under a single opt-in. The AI host must implement consent tracking with revocation processing within 10 calendar days.

2. **Six major loyalty programs documented** with specific tier thresholds, earning rates, and comp formulas. The universal theoretical loss formula is: `Theo = AvgBet x HouseEdge x Decisions/Hr x Hours`. Comp allocation ranges from 15-40% of theoretical loss depending on tier and property.

3. **Mohegan Sun opened four new restaurants in June 2025** (Beauty & Essex, Farm Italy, SIFT, The Shed), significantly expanding its dining portfolio. Foxwoods features Ramsay, Fieri, and Morimoto celebrity chef concepts.

4. **Hotel operations span a massive price range**: $150/night standard rooms to $15,000+/night ultra-VIP villas. Resort fees range up to $55/night at luxury properties, with loyalty tier waivers available. Upgrade policies are ADT-driven with dynamic thresholds.

5. **Self-exclusion programs are mandatory** across all regulated states. The AI host MUST check self-exclusion lists before ANY outreach -- marketing, SMS, email, or direct contact. Violations carry severe penalties including license revocation.

## 1. US Casino Marketing Regulations

### 1.1 TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act)

The TCPA is the primary federal regulation governing casino SMS and telemarketing outreach. The AI host must comply with all TCPA requirements before initiating any patron communication.

#### Prior Express Written Consent (PEWC)

- **Requirement**: Prior express written consent is REQUIRED for all SMS marketing messages to casino patrons.
- **Format**: Written agreement (paper or electronic) that clearly authorizes the specific sender to deliver marketing messages, includes the phone number to receive messages, and is signed by the consumer.
- **Scope**: Consent must be specific to the casino property or operator. A blanket "marketing consent" without identifying the sender is insufficient.
- **Revocation**: Patrons may revoke consent at any time via any reasonable method (reply STOP, call, email, in-person request).

#### 10-Day Revocation Window (Effective April 2025)

- **New rule**: As of April 11, 2025, senders must honor consent revocations within **10 business days** of receipt.
- **Previous standard**: "Reasonable time" (typically 30 days in practice).
- **Impact on AI host**: The system must process opt-out requests and update patron records within 10 calendar days. Messages sent after 10 days post-revocation constitute TCPA violations.
- **Implementation**: Automated opt-out processing pipeline with timestamp tracking and hard cutoff enforcement.

#### FCC One-to-One Consent Rule (Vacated January 2025)

- **Background**: The FCC adopted a rule in December 2023 requiring "one-to-one" consent -- meaning consumers would need to consent to receive messages from each individual sender separately, rather than consenting to a group of related entities under a single opt-in.
- **Vacated**: In January 2025, the US Court of Appeals vacated this rule before it took effect, finding the FCC exceeded its authority.
- **Current state**: A single opt-in can cover multiple related entities (e.g., a casino resort's hotel, restaurants, and entertainment under one consent), provided the consent form clearly identifies the entities.
- **Impact on AI host**: The agent can send messages on behalf of multiple casino departments (dining, hotel, entertainment, comps) under a single patron consent, as long as the consent form lists these categories.

#### Calling and Messaging Hours

- **Federal TCPA**: Marketing calls and messages prohibited before **8:00 AM** and after **9:00 PM** in the recipient's local time zone.
- **Implementation**: The AI host must determine patron time zone (from profile or area code) and enforce quiet hours strictly.
- **State overrides**: Some states have stricter windows (see state-specific rules below).

#### Penalties

- **Per-violation**: $500 per unsolicited message (trebled to $1,500 for willful violations).
- **Class action exposure**: Casino patron databases are large; a single campaign error can generate millions in liability.
- **FCC enforcement**: Additional fines up to $50,120 per call/message for DNC violations as of 2025 inflation adjustment.

### 1.2 State-by-State Self-Exclusion Programs

Self-exclusion programs allow individuals to voluntarily ban themselves from casino gambling. The AI host MUST check self-exclusion lists before ANY patron outreach.

#### New Jersey (NJ)

- **Administering body**: NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE).
- **Exclusion periods**: 1 year, 5 years, or lifetime.
- **Scope**: All NJ licensed casinos and online platforms.
- **Marketing prohibition**: Casinos MUST remove self-excluded individuals from ALL marketing lists. No direct mail, email, SMS, or targeted digital ads.
- **Penalty for violation**: Fines $500-$1,000 per violation; potential license sanctions.
- **AI host requirement**: Query NJ DGE self-exclusion database (or casino's synchronized copy) before every outreach action.

#### Nevada (NV)

- **No state-run program**: Nevada does NOT have a mandatory state self-exclusion program.
- **Voluntary programs**: Individual casinos operate their own self-exclusion lists.
- **Implication for AI host**: Must check each property's internal exclusion list. There is no centralized state database to query.
- **Note**: The Nevada Gaming Control Board maintains an "Excluded Persons List" (involuntary, for cheaters/criminals), which is separate from voluntary self-exclusion.

#### Connecticut (CT)

- **Administering body**: Varies by compact. Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods operate under separate tribal-state compacts.
- **Mohegan Sun**: Self-exclusion managed by the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority.
- **Foxwoods**: Self-exclusion managed by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Gaming Commission.
- **Duration**: Varies by compact terms; typically 1 year minimum with lifetime option.
- **Cross-property**: Self-exclusion at one CT tribal casino does NOT automatically apply to the other. Patrons must enroll separately.
- **AI host requirement**: Maintain separate exclusion list integrations for each CT tribal property.

#### Pennsylvania (PA)

- **Administering body**: Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB).
- **Exclusion periods**: 1 year, 5 years, or lifetime.
- **Scope**: All PA licensed casinos, online gambling, and sports betting.
- **Marketing prohibition**: Strict. Self-excluded patrons must be removed from all marketing databases within 15 days of enrollment.
- **Penalty**: Up to $75,000 per violation for licensees.

#### Michigan (MI)

- **Administering body**: Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB).
- **Exclusion periods**: 1 year or lifetime.
- **Scope**: All MI commercial casinos and tribal casinos (by compact).
- **Marketing prohibition**: Self-excluded individuals must not receive any marketing materials.
- **Responsible gambling fund**: Casinos contribute to state responsible gambling programs.

### 1.3 Responsible Gaming Advertising Requirements

State-specific requirements for responsible gaming messaging in casino marketing materials.

#### New York (NY)

- **Requirement**: ALL casino advertisements must include a problem gambling message.
- **Mandated text**: Must include the state problem gambling helpline number (1-877-8-HOPENY).
- **Scope**: Print, digital, broadcast, social media, SMS -- all channels.
- **AI host impact**: Every outbound marketing message must append the responsible gaming helpline.

#### Illinois (IL)

- **College campus ban**: Effective August 2025, NO casino advertising within 1,500 feet of a college campus or targeting individuals under 21 on college campuses.
- **Digital targeting**: Geo-fencing must exclude college campus zones.
- **Responsible gaming message**: Required in all advertising, with state helpline number.
- **AI host impact**: If geo-targeting SMS, exclude college campus coordinates.

#### Connecticut (CT)

- **Misleading keywords prohibited**: Advertising cannot use misleading terms such as "guaranteed win," "risk-free," "free money" or similar terms that misrepresent the nature of gambling.
- **Truthful claims only**: All promotional claims (comp values, odds, win rates) must be substantiated.
- **AI host impact**: Response generation must never use prohibited promotional language. The compliance gate must filter these terms.

### 1.4 State-Specific Opt-In Rules

#### Florida (FL)

- **Express written consent**: Required for all SMS marketing (aligns with TCPA PEWC).
- **Message frequency cap**: Maximum 3 messages per day per patron.
- **Messaging hours**: Restricted to **8:00 AM - 8:00 PM** local time (stricter than federal 8 AM - 9 PM).
- **AI host impact**: Implement per-patron daily message counter and FL-specific quiet hours.

#### Indiana (IN)

- **SMS treated as sales calls**: Indiana classifies marketing SMS messages as "sales calls" under state telemarketing law.
- **Implication**: All state telemarketing regulations apply to SMS, including registration requirements, disclosure obligations, and Do Not Call list compliance.
- **AI host impact**: SMS outreach to IN patrons must comply with both TCPA and IN telemarketing statutes.

#### New Jersey (NJ)

- **Violation penalties**: $500 for first offense, escalating to $1,000 per subsequent violation for unsolicited marketing contacts.
- **Strict enforcement**: NJ DGE actively monitors casino marketing compliance.
- **Pattern of violations**: Repeated violations can result in license conditions, suspension, or revocation.

### 1.5 DNC (Do Not Call) Compliance

- **National DNC Registry**: Casinos must scrub marketing lists against the FTC National Do Not Call Registry.
- **Internal DNC list**: Casinos must maintain an internal DNC list of patrons who have requested no marketing contact. This list takes precedence over any prior consent.
- **Federal penalty**: Up to **$50,120 per call** (2025 inflation-adjusted) for calling numbers on the DNC registry without valid consent.
- **State penalties**: Vary from $1,000 to $25,000 per violation depending on jurisdiction.
- **AI host implementation**: Every outbound contact must be checked against both the National DNC Registry and the property's internal DNC list.

### 1.6 BSA/AML Marketing Implications

The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations have direct implications for casino marketing, particularly when targeting high-value patrons.

- **AMLA 2020 (Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020)**: Updated penalties and expanded scope for financial crimes, including casino operations.
- **Maximum penalties**: Up to **$1,000,000 per violation** and **10 years imprisonment** for willful BSA/AML violations.
- **Marketing implications**:
  - Casino marketing to known high-value players must not facilitate structuring (breaking transactions to avoid CTR thresholds).
  - Comp offers cannot be used as inducements to structure transactions.
  - Marketing campaigns targeting specific patron segments must be reviewed for potential AML red flags.
  - The AI host must NOT encourage specific transaction amounts or patterns that could constitute structuring.
- **CTR (Currency Transaction Report)**: Required for cash transactions exceeding $10,000 in a gaming day.
- **SAR (Suspicious Activity Report)**: Required for transactions $5,000+ that the casino knows or suspects involve unlawful activity.

### 1.7 Age Verification

- **Minimum gambling age**: 21+ in most states with commercial casinos (NJ, NV, PA, MI, CT, etc.). Some tribal casinos allow 18+ depending on compact terms.
- **AI host requirement**: Age verification must be confirmed before any marketing outreach, comp offers, or booking assistance.
- **Online/digital**: Additional COPPA and state privacy law considerations for digital patron interactions.

## 2. Casino Loyalty Program Structures

### 2.1 Theoretical Loss Formula

The universal formula used by all major casino loyalty programs to calculate a patron's theoretical loss (and thereby their comp value):

```
Theoretical Loss (Theo) = Average Bet x House Edge x Decisions per Hour x Hours Played
```

**Variables**:
- **Average Bet**: Patron's average wager per decision (tracked by player card).
- **House Edge**: Statistical advantage by game (see table below).
- **Decisions per Hour**: Number of betting decisions per hour by game type.
- **Hours Played**: Duration of rated play.

#### House Edge by Game

| Game | House Edge | Decisions/Hour |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Blackjack (basic strategy) | 0.5-1.5% | 70-80 |
| Blackjack (average player) | 2.0% | 70-80 |
| Craps (pass line) | 1.41% | 100-120 |
| Craps (field) | 5.56% | 100-120 |
| Roulette (double zero) | 5.26% | 40-50 |
| Roulette (single zero) | 2.70% | 40-50 |
| Baccarat (banker) | 1.06% | 70-80 |
| Baccarat (player) | 1.24% | 70-80 |
| Slots (penny) | 8-12% | 600-800 |
| Slots (dollar) | 3-6% | 400-600 |
| Video Poker (optimal) | 0.5-2% | 400-500 |
| Pai Gow Poker | 2.5% | 30-40 |

**Example calculation**:
A patron playing blackjack at $100/hand for 4 hours:
`Theo = $100 x 0.02 x 75 x 4 = $600`
At 30% comp rate, this patron earns $180 in comps.

### 2.2 Comp Allocation Rates

| Tier Level | Comp Rate (% of Theo) | Typical ADT Range |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Basic / Entry | 15-20% | Under $100 |
| Mid-tier | 20-25% | $100-$300 |
| Upper-tier | 25-30% | $300-$500 |
| Premium / VIP | 30-35% | $500-$1,000 |
| Ultra-VIP / Invite | 35-40% | $1,000+ |

### 2.3 ADT (Average Daily Theoretical) Thresholds
